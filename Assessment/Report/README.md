## Introduction
This project aims to develop Egde Impulse and transfer learning based UK coin classification system, which ables to classify 5 catrgories coin (1 penty, 5 pence, 10 pence, 20 pence, 50 pence) with over 80% accuracy. Initial idea comes from the scenario that UK coin always choas in daily life, it's hard to quickly tell them apart especially when checking out. 

Traditional vending machines identify coins based on their size (Segrave, 2015). However, many coins have similar sizes but different values, which leads to recognition errors. This problem becomes worse when coins are worn out or stacked together. By contrast, manual sorting is a way to solve but time-consuming. In that case, an efficient classification system needed. 

Previous studies have shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can perform better than the human eye in recognizing coins (Xiang and Yan, 2021). Building on this, Jahan et al. (2023) proposed a deep learning model using MobileNetV2 for global coin detection, which is a compact and efficient neural network based on depth-wise separable convolutions, achieving an accuracy of 84.24%.

## Research Question
Is it able to develop a system that run on mobile phone to quick classify the UK coin?

## Application Overview
Thinking back to the various application diagrams you have seen through the module - how would you describe an overview of the building blocks of your project - how do they connect, what do the component parts include.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to convey your design!*

## Data
The data comes from online open source and self-collection.

Describe what data sources you have used and any cleaning, wrangling or organising you have done. Including some examples of the data helps others understand what you have been working with.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!*

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*Tip: probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*Tip: probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
